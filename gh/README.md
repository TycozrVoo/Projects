**GH**

Is a GitHub User and Organization querier built with Flask that works on Replit. The User side is done, but Organization still needs to be finished.
This application presents a Python backend with HTML and JavaScript added in the templates and static folders.
The project can also be viewed <a href="https://replit.com/@FirestarDev/gh">here</a>

**An API and GitHub API Wrapper for this project is currently WIP**
